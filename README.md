First React App built

A clone of the google keep app that isn't currently deployed because to I'd want to add the backend functionality to feel like it was functional enought to deploy.

A video of how it works is below.

This taught me a lot to build. I found out I really enojy using react and I feel like it gave me a better understandng of my ability to code, and look for answer that aren't laid out for me when adding new parts to code.

This was a project for my bootcamp and we were give the basic CSS but I have updated it. The styling choices we a combo of given and chosen. But I coded each aspect. The original given code was react 17 which was perfectly fine but I had update it to react 18 in the process of looking through the developer tools and changed the necessary pats for that.
